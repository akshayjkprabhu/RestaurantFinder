Problem Statement
Restaurants Search Feature
Consider we have 2 json files.
1) Contains the restaurants list with details, cuisine types & reviews
2) Contains the menu items of the restaurants.
Functionality to be implemented:
Search feature in the order of items/cuisine types/restaurants. Ex:
● If a user searches with text “Biryani”, then the results should list out all restaurants which serve Biryani.
● If a user searches with text “Indian”, then search results should be all the restaurants of cuisine type “Indian” irrespective of menu items.
● If a user searches with text “Shanti Sagar”, then the search results should be all the restaurants with the name Shanti Sagar.
Consider the app doesn’t know what exactly the user is searching, so based on the text he types, narrow down the search results from both data models, & give consolidated results.
Notes:
● Use below given json files for development (No need to use any API for data).
● Search results should start displaying as user types.
● There is no API provided for this, you should use a given json sample to create your own json file with multiple data for efficient
implementation.
● Results should show the content that matches the search text. ● Good to use OOPs concepts for design & structuring the app.
Some guidelines:
● Feel free to use any open source software you wish. Be prepared to answer questions about *why* you chose any libraries that you add to the project.
● Treat this app as something you control technically. The way you choose to architect your solution will be a key aspect of the app review. ● Do your best to follow modern Android conventions and write clean, performant, and extensible code.
● Imagine that this app will continue to grow after you are done- how would another developer add additional screens or other functionality?
● While writing tests is not a requirement, be prepared to discuss how you would approach testing this project during the review. Having tests is one way to kickstart that discussion and showcase your approach. ● Be sure the app looks great on a variety of screen sizes!
